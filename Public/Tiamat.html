        <h1>About Tiamat</h1>
        <img src="./assets/Tiamat_infobox.png" width="250" alt="">
        <p class="first">Tiamat, also dubbed Titanus Tiamat, was a giant serpentine Titan created by Legendary Pictures that appears in Legendary's 2019 film, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, as a name briefly seen on a monitor. She made her first full appearance in the graphic novel Godzilla Dominion. She later makes her on-screen debut in the 2024 film, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, where she is killed by Godzilla..
             
            <h3>History</h3>
            Tiamat was found in Stone Mountain, Georgia, USA, by Monarch, who built Outpost 53 around her. When Ghidorah calls all the Titans, Tiamat breaks free and begins to hunt with her new pack. When the ORCA calls all Titans to Boston, Tiamat does not arrive in time for the battle and does not see Godzilla become the alpha of all Titans again (except Kong).
            <br>Battered and exhausted from his battle with Ghidorah as well as several other rebellious Titans, Godzilla returns to one of his old lairs to rest but immediately senses that something is different. The Alpha Titan is suddenly ambushed by Tiamat, who sucks him into a whirlpool. Tiamat then belches toxic vapor into Godzilla's face, which disorients him. With Godzilla blinded and stunned, Tiamat drags him deeper underwater, constricting and slicing into him with her scales. Eventually, the two bring the battle into the lair itself, where Godzilla is able to overpower Tiamat and force her to submit. Defeated, Tiamat retreats back into the ocean, forfeiting the lair back into Godzilla's control. <br>Looking to gain power, Godzilla travels to Tiamat's new lair in the Arctic Ocean which sits upon the planet's largest deposit of natural radiation. Upon Godzilla's arrival and the firing of his atomic breath, Tiamat awakens to defend her new lair, and wraps herself around Godzilla, constricting him. After Godzilla retaliates by biting off a chunk of her flesh, the titanic sea serpent bites onto Godzilla's face and also begins to smother him with her frills. Charging up, Godzilla blasts through Tiamat with his atomic breath, cutting her to pieces. As Tiamat's mangled body parts begin to rise to the surface, Godzilla briefly rises up to toss away one of Tiamat's limbs before diving back down to claim her lair. <br><br>

            <h3>Personality</h3>
            Tiamat is very territorial and will fight other Titans for dominance. However, she recognizes when the odds are against her, and when beaten by Godzilla after an intense battle, Tiamat is visibly frightened and submits to the Alpha Titan to save herself from being killed. Her aggressive and destructive nature has led to Monarch classifying Tiamat as a "Destroyer".<br>
            Several years later, Tiamat is still shown to be very aggressive and unyielding to authority even after being beaten by Godzilla, with their second battle resulting in him killing her after she refused to back down. 
            
            <h3>Design</h3> 
            In Godzilla Dominion, Tiamat is portrayed as a titanic serpentine creature, and is light blue in coloration while also having vibrant purple scales. These scales are serrated and knife-like. Her skull is draconic with yellow eyes and four barbels extending from it. Extending from near her head are two wing-like fins. <br>In Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, Tiamat possesses a drastically different appearance in comparison to her design throughout the graphic novels. In the film, Tiamat is dark green in coloration with numerous purple serrated fins that run through the length of her entire body. Additionally, she possesses four clawed limbs. She retains her draconic skull, which is surrounded by yellow frills that open and fold depending on her mood. A bright bioluminescent magenta color now lights the tips of her fins.
