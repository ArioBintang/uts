        <h1>About King Ghidorah</h1>
        <img src="./assets/1000 (2).png" width="250" alt="">
        <p class="first">King Ghidorah (キングギドラ Kingu Gidora?), also dubbed Monster Zero, Titanus Ghidorah or just simply 
          Ghidorah, is a giant extraterrestrial three-headed dragon daikaiju created by Legendary Pictures.<br>The main antagonist 
          of the MonsterVerse, Ghidorah was first alluded to during the final moments the 2017 film, Kong: Skull Island, became 
          the main antagonist of the 2019 film, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and was one of the overarching antagonists of 
          Godzilla vs. Kong.<br>A rival alpha predator to Godzilla, Ghidorah was discovered by Monarch lying dormant inside an 
          Antarctic glacier. In 2019, he was freed by Emma Russell and Alan Jonah's eco-terrorist paramilitary as part of their 
          plan to manipulate the Titans and renew the world's ecosphere; unaware that Ghidorah was an alien who was incompatible 
          with Earth’s established natural order. Proving impossible to control with the ORCA, Ghidorah temporarily succeeded in 
          usurping Godzilla’s dominance, spontaneously awakening the other Titans and commanding them to begin destroying both 
          humanity and the world's ecosystems. Ghidorah managed to cause worldwide destruction and loss of life before he was 
          defeated and killed by the combined efforts of Godzilla, Mothra, the military, Monarch and the Russell family.<br>
          Following Ghidorah's apparent demise, the skull of his leftover severed head was converted by Apex Cybernetics into 
          a semi-organic psionic control system for Mechagodzilla. This unwittingly enabled what remained of Ghidorah's 
          consciousness to reincarnate into the Mecha for a brief time, before it was destroyed by Godzilla and Kong with the 
          aid of Madison Russell, Bernie Hayes and Josh Valentine.
             
            <h3>History</h3>
            Kong: Skull Island
            In 1973, Houston Brooks and San Lin briefed James Conrad and Mason Weaver on multiple other monsters who once ruled the world
            alongside Kong. This included Ghidorah, along with Godzilla, Mothra, and Rodan, who were all shown to the two via classified 
            Monarch cave paintings.<br>
            2016
            Ghidorah was discovered under the ice via the Reolus satellite, which detected an extreme electromagnetic pulse fluctuation 
            from the frozen creature.[3] In 2016, Vivienne Graham led an effort to build a containment and research facility (Outpost 32) 
            around Ghidorah. Her classified field notes contained the mysterious footnote, "The devil has three heads."[1] The creature was 
            later dubbed 'Monster Zero' by Monarch scientist Dr. Emma Russell.[27] <br>
            Godzilla: King of the Monsters
            GhidorahFrozen Ghidorah is first seen frozen in Antarctic ice at Outpost 32. Eco-terrorist organization leader Alan Jonah and 
            rogue Monarch agent Emma Russell free him with explosives and awaken him with the ORCA.
            Upon awakening, Ghidorah slaughters the G-Team forces on the ground before turning his attention to a grounded Osprey aircraft. Shortly 
            after, Godzilla emerges from the ice and the two Titans engage in battle, decimating the remains of Outpost 32. Upon briefly 
            gaining the upper-hand over Godzilla, Ghidorah targets and eats Dr. Graham alive, but is distracted from targeting the 
            remaining humans on the ground by Monarch's aerial forces firing missiles to distract him. When Godzilla recovers amid 
            Ghidorah's distraction, Ghidorah escapes into the sky and flees Antarctica, rapidly forming a growing cyclone around 
            himself as he passes over Brazil.
            <h3>Personality</h3>
            Ghidorah is arguably the most malevolent and hostile Titan encountered so far. Unlike the other Titans, who attack humans 
            or cause damage due to provocation, carnivorous hunger or merely by being indifferent to the humans and structures 
            surrounding them, Ghidorah displays true malice. He willingly tries to kill as many humans as he can, whether they're 
            trying to pose a threat to him or not, and there are glimpses of all three of his heads seemingly smiling when he's just 
            killed or is about to attack (more information on that below). Ghidorah also initially displays a willingness to toy with 
            or curiously investigate humans before killing them, such as when his heads attempted to slowly crush the human-filled 
            Osprey in Antarctica. Ghidorah notably prefers killing humans with his gravity beams, despite this being overkill for such 
            comparatively small creatures.<br>Ghidorah actively seeks to usurp command of Earth's Titans from Godzilla, and upon 
            successfully doing so, he immediately commands the other Titans to join him in creating natural disasters and wreaking 
            destruction on a global scale, to a point where the likely end result if the global rampage continues will be the 
            eradication of all multicellular life except for Ghidorah within a few years[19][20][8]. Upon becoming aware of Ghidorah's
             extraterrestrial nature, Rick Stanton compares him to an invasive species and suspects that the purpose of his apocalypse 
             is terraforming (xenoforming) the planet into a more ideal place for Ghidorah to live. Ishiro Serizawa, Mark Russell and 
             Emma Russell all run with the same assumption[21][22][23]; but Mark at one point alternatively speculates that Ghidorah 
             perhaps simply hates every living thing that isn't him and desires to destroy it all as a motivation and an end-goal in 
             and of itself[21]. Upon usurping Godzilla's position as the reigning alpha, Ghidorah seems to exhibit a controlling streak 
             and possessiveness of his new position that he didn't have before; whereas he'd previously disregarded the ORCA's Alpha 
             signal in Antarctica as soon as it ceased broadcasting, during the Boston battle to maintain his control of the other 
             Titans, Ghidorah instead went as far as immediately abandoning the fight with Godzilla once he sensed the ORCA signal 
             challenging his dominance.
            <h3>Design</h3> 
            Like most of his past incarnations, Ghidorah is larger than Godzilla. Ghidorah's wings are much larger and more 
            bat-like in appearance than most incarnations - the membrane of each wing is supported by four bat-like phalanges 
            extending from Ghidorah's wrists, and an additional three phalanges that extend from the sides of Ghidorah's torso. 
            All these phalanges end in blade-like tips that emerge from the wing membrane. Though Ghidorah takes on a bipedal 
            stance when standing still, unlike past incarnations, Ghidorah is able to move on his legs and uses his wings as 
            forelimbs to support his massive body for crawling or even running when needed. Ghidorah still has his traditional 
            twin tails with spiked bludgeons at their tips that can rattle as an intimidation display. His legs are digitigrade 
            and stocky with avian-like feet, similar to the 2001 incarnation. When Ghidorah's left head is ripped off, his blood 
            is shown to be black and oil-like.<br>Each head has a crown of ten horns similar to the Heisei incarnation, which tend
            to flare depending on Ghidorah's current mood. There are subtle differences in each head's horn array. The horns of 
            the middle head are notably longer, more curved, and more decorative than the other two, while the left head has 
            straighter horns than the right head. Furthermore, one of the right head's left horns is chipped. The left head appears 
            to have a slightly more rectangular facial structure with slightly further-apart eyes than the other two. The middle 
            head's neck has two rows of spines while the left and right necks only have one. Ghidorah's heads each have crocodilian-
            looking jaws with flaring nostrils, forked tongue, and brows with a generally furrowed appearance. His eyes are beady and
            have a fiery reddish-orange color and circular pupils, and they tend to glint or glow blazing yellow at a distance 
            (particularly noticeable in the dark) or when he prepares to fire his gravity beams. Ghidorah's necks also emit golden 
            light of electricity from within whenever he charges up and fires his gravity beams.</p>
